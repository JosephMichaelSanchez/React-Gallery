# Weekend-React-Gallery

## Weekend Challenge #4

### Description

The goal of Weekend Challenge #4 was to create an interactive image gallery using React. The finished image gallery should have functionality similar to Facebook, where clicking a 'Like' button underneath a picture added a 'like' to the image. This change should 
be immediately reflected on the DOM, by displaying the newly-added 'like' to the image's previous total.

In addition, clicking on an image should replace the picture with a text description of the picture. Clicking the text description 
should bring back the image.
